## General Information
- Problem Statement 
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:

-Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

-How well those variables describe the price of a house.

-Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Also there is part 2 of this problem statement which consist of some questions related to the business goals.
the answers of same will be solved in jupyter notebook and provided in the pdf file attached with this assignment.

Business Goal:
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- The below mentioned factorts/variable are significant in predicting the price
LotArea      -   Lot size in square feet

OverallQual  -   Rates the overall material and finish of the house

YearBuilt    -   Original construction date

BsmtFinSF1   -  Type 1 finished square feet

TotalBsmtSF  -  Total square feet of basement area

GrLivArea    -  Above grade (ground) living area square feet

TotRmsAbvGrd -  Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)

Street_Pave  -  Pave road access to propertyConclusion 1 from the analysis
